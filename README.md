About the program:
this program is created on 21th September, 2020. Everyone should mark the date when the issue happened, and should put all the necessary information above the content(e.g. version of MacOS, whether it is virtual system or on real hardware, whether using VMware or VirtualBox, the host system of your computer)
Please use English to communicate. Of course, other languages are accepted, if it happens that another person uses this language.
Be calm, be moral. Be nice to others.
This is not a market. No trade here.
No religion, no politics, no prejudice.

About Hackintosh itself:
As the name suggested, it is combined with "hacking" and "Macintosh".
Please appreciate and be aware that all the goodness is provided by Apple. No apple, no Macintosh. Please support Apple and buy a MacBook&iMac if you need it. If you just want to toss this stuff, you are free to do it here, and everywhere.

About me:
Well, I am just enthusiastic about Hackintosh. I am a high school student, and is planning to buy a MacBook Pro after graduation. (Running out of money currently)
I am not good at programming, so please don't ask me specific questions. Do not email me. That's quite a lot for a student with endless homework.
